#  Interactive Gibson Environment
**Large Scale Virtualized Interactive Environments for Robot Learning**

Interactive Gibson is a simulation environment providing fast visual rendering and physics simulation (based on Bullet). It is packed with a dataset with hundreds of large 3D environments reconstructed from real homes and offices, and interactive objects that can be pushed and actuated. Interactive Gibson allows to train and evaluate robotic agents that use RGB images and/or other visual sensors to solve indoor (interactive) navigation and manipulation tasks such as opening doors, picking up and placing objects, or searching in cabinets.
